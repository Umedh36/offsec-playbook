# NMAP

_Nmap is tool is used for the scan the network_

```shell-session
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn  | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

The scan perform these: the first the Nmap scan whole network 10.129.2.0 . the -sn for the disable port scan we don't scan the ports we just scan the which ip address are in active . after that "|" that symbol for the before output want to share . grep is search operator for means the loops turns how many active networks is there as per the loops turns. the cut command works for the remove all removing -d " " give just space for each and give the value for it after 5 clomons.

It scan's the top 10 ports not the 1 to 10 ports . --top-ports=10 => it scans the top 10 ports -F => scans the top 100 ports -p- => scans the all ports 0 to 65535 -p 22 => it scans only 22 port number -p 22,33 => it scan both 22 and 33 ports -p 22-33 =>d it scans the ports b/w the 22 to 33 -sT => for the tcp scan

_**when a port got the filter these are the reasons**_ -> When a port is shown as filtered, it can have several reasons. In most cases, firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be `dropped`, or `rejected`. When a packet gets dropped, `Nmap` receives no response from our target, and by default --disable-arp-ping => disables the arp ping -Pn => disable ICMP Echo request -sU => perform udp scan --reason => gives the reason for the output --packet-trace => we can trace the packet _**SAVING THE RESULTS**_ We can also specify the option (`-oA`) to save the results in all formats. The command could look like this

* Normal output (`-oN`) with the `.nmap` file extension
* Grepable output (`-oG`) with the `.gnmap` file extension
* XML output (`-oX`) with the `.xml` file extension -> In normal words when we use -oA for the save the output automatic the three kind of .nmap , .gnmap , .xml -> suppose we perform this scan

```shell-session
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -oA target

```shell-session
ls

```

when i open the target.nmap it is normal output

```shell-session

_**Suppose i want a HTML output**_ With the XML output, we can easily create HTML reports that are easy to read, even for non-technical people. This is later very useful for documentation, as it presents our results in a detailed and clear way. To convert the stored results from XML format to HTML, we can use the tool `xsltproc`.

```shell-session
xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
```

it can create the HTML page by using the .xml file .&#x20;

_**SERVICE ENUMERATION**_ -sV => for version scan -v => Increases the verbosity of the scan, which displays more detailed information. --status-every=5s => it status for the every 5 seconds

### Timing

Because such settings cannot always be optimized manually, as in a black-box penetration test, `Nmap` offers six different timing templates (`-T <0-5>`) for us to use. These values (`0-5`) determine the aggressiveness of our scans. This can also have negative effects if the scan is too aggressive, and security systems may block us due to the produced network traffic. The default timing template used when we have defined nothing else is the normal (`-T 3`).

* `-T 0` / `-T paranoid`
* `-T 1` / `-T sneaky`
* `-T 2` / `-T polite`
* `-T 3` / `-T normal`
* `-T 4` / `-T aggressive`
* `-T 5` / `-T insane`

```shell-session
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.T5 -T 5
